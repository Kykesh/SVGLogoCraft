# SVGLogoCraft
 SVGLogoCraft is a Node.js command-line application designed to empower freelance web developers with the ability to generate simple, customizable logos for their projects. Without needing to invest in graphic design services, users can specify their desired text (up to three characters), text color, shape (from a choice of circle, triangle, or square), and shape color to create a personalized logo. The logo is saved as an SVG file, enabling easy integration into web projects or further customization. This repository contains all necessary files, including the application code, example generated SVG files, and comprehensive unit tests for each shape using Jest. Follow the README for setup instructions and watch the walkthrough video to see SVGLogoCraft in action, demonstrating its utility in streamlining the creation of project logos.
